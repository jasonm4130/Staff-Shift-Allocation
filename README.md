# Staff-Shift-Allocation

## Initial Thoughts
Shift allocation will require a few main concepts:
1. Staff members (including hours worked in the current week and availability)
2. Shifts
3. Staff to shift relationship to record which staff members have been assigned to what shifts
4. ability to generate a roster from the proposed schedule
